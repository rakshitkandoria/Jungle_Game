# Storyline Details
## Beginning
- The man crashes his car and starts running, with the player choosing the direction to take.
## First Decision
- If the player chooses left (1), a lion starts chasing the man. The man faces multiple choices that either lead to his death or his triumph over the lion.
## Alternate Path
- If the player chooses right (2), the man initially jumps on the lion, and the outcome depends on whether the player chooses further actions (either befriending the lion, attending a party, or defeating it in a fight).
# Possible Endings
### 1. GAME OVER: The man is eaten by a lion or killed by other animals in the jungle.
### 2. Victory: The man defeats the lion in a final confrontation after an argument.
# Requirements
Python 3.x or higher.
Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts.
# Troubleshooting
Ensure that your input is an integer (either 1 or 2).
If the game does not run correctly, check that Python is properly installed and that the script is correctly formatted.
